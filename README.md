# 🧙 erasmuscup.com – The Official House Cup Platform of 2025™

## 1. Overview

Welcome to **erasmuscup.com**, the unstoppable, irrefutable, and *totally* not cult-like hub for this semester’s Harry Potter-inspired Erasmus House Cup. We’ve got Houses, we’ve got Crimes, we’ve got Yards of beer, and we’ve got an apparently unstoppable plague of *public nudity.*  

Here, you can:  
- **Monitor** the real-time leaderboard of House Points, murders (shockingly unpunished), and attendance achievements  
- **Consult** official House Cup laws, so you know exactly how badly your next Treason attempt might go  
- **Organize** weekly events (avoid Blood Moons) and spontaneous Gambits (or **Super** Gambits if you’re feeling *extra*)  
- **Cash in** your House Points for jelly beans, while navigating bizarre punishments in the official Constitution  

And, of course: **this is definitely not a cult**. We keep repeating that, so it must be true.

## 2. The Four Houses

When you join, our apparently foolproof **16Personalities Test** sorts you into your final resting place—err, House—until the end of the Strawberry Moon. Meet your fates:

| House            | Mascot     | Motto                                     |
|------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 🐊 **House Brew**   | Alligator  | "Veni, Vidi, Bibi – we came, we saw, we drank."                |
| 🦉 **House Hoo**    | Owl        | "Mentes acutæ, unguibus acutioribus."  |
| 🐅 **House Tiger**  | Tiger      | "Victory Through Vibes."                   |
| 🦝 **House Jungle** | Raccoon    | "Smart lemurs, clever play. Think first, then slay." |

**Founding Principle**: If your House is losing at the final tally, you will be *hanged publicly* unless you chug a yard of beer in time. Democracy at its finest.

## 3. Features

- **📊 Leaderboard**  
  Tracks your House Points and all the ways you can lose them: Buffaloing, Nudity, and opening beverages incorrectly (How’s That’ed).

- **📆 Weekly & Surprise Events**  
  Never on Blood Moons. Participate if you don’t want to hemorrhage House Points.

- **⚖️ Extra Crimes & Strange Punishments**  
  *Murder?* No actual punishment. *Constructive Feedback?* Immediate death by Strawberry Moon Execution. Seems fair.

- **💥 Super Gambits**  
  Dynamically scalable point totals for large-scale meltdown events.

- **🪧 Armistices**  
  Sometimes you need to ally with your sworn House enemies to chase bigger points… or cheat fate.

- **🕵️ House Judge Role**  
  Elected to interpret rules, resolve disputes, and occasionally dock points from *every* house. No one is safe.

- **📡 Nudity Geo-Tracking** *(In Progress)*  
  Because awarding points for going full-birthday-suit *once per half-semester* just isn’t enough. Soon, we’ll map it too.

## 4. Legal Framework Highlights

- **House Points**: Win them in events, lose them for Cheating, Buffaloing, or existing incorrectly.  
- **Armistices**: Collude with other Houses; the official rules say it’s (sometimes) legal.  
- **Gambits & Super Gambits**: Impromptu events carrying serious point stakes—some with bigger multipliers.  
- **Punishable Crimes**: Treason (very bad), Constructive Feedback (worse?), Public Nudity (ironically *earns* you points), and of course, the ultimate crime of **Losing**.  
- **Murder**: Part of the rules, with no specified penalty.

See the unabridged madness in the [House Cup Rules 2025](./House-Cup-Rules.md).

## 5. Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Like a magical front door to House Cup mania.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Stylish, minimal fluff – unlike our legal code.
- **Framer Motion**: Animations so smooth they’ll make your yard glass slip right out of your hand.
- **React Router**: You can run, but you can’t hide from the rules. (But you can navigate them.)

### Hosting
- **Netlify**: Quick loading for our bizarre leaderboards and weekly fiasco announcements.
- **Firebase (Planned)**: Because eventually we want live updates the moment someone disrobes in public.

## 6. Developer Setup

1. **Clone** this insanity:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/erasmuscup/erasmuscup.com.git
   cd erasmuscup.com
   ```
2. **Install** dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run** the dev server:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Build** for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

(You do realize you need an official House Cup registration or a *consensual* Blood Oath, right?)

## 7. Design Philosophy

- **Fully Embracing the Madness**: Our laws are comedic but non-negotiable.  
- **Absolute House Identity**: Mascots, anthems, war cries—this is your House family, for better or (very likely) worse.  
- **User Experience**: Overshadowed by chaotic rules and fear of losing. (Still better than forgetting to say “not out.”)  
- **Mobile-First**: Because you never know where you’ll need to record a Gambit or public nudity.

---

## 8. Roadmap

- **🧮 Super Gambit System**: More participants = more points (and possibly more betrayal).  
- **📜 Interactive Constitution Browser**: So you can argue about Tenth Amendment issues with your House Judge in real time.  
- **📸 Nudity Map™**: Like Pokémon GO, but for streakers.  
- **🗳️ Potential Fifth House**: *House Shrimp? House Sloth?* Democracy shall decide.  
- **🎆 Fireworks for Treason Prevention**: Light up the sky every time you *don’t* overthrow the event organizers.  
- **💬 Whistleblower Hotline**: Snitch (pun intended) on your House for personal gain.

---

## 9. License

- **Code**: MIT License  
- **Creative Assets**: Strictly © House Cup Parliament 2025—use them in real governments at your own risk.  
- **Rules & Crimes**: Also absolutely not recommended for real-world policy-making (please, no).
